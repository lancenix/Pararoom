# 🔮 Pararoom 🔮
#### *A submission for the Nano Challenge 3 Project at Apple Developer Academy*

## 🎮 Project Description
Pararoom is an escape room game with AR Experience that puts a bit of sci-fi theme into it. Designed so the game scene feels like it takes place in a parallel dimension. Hence, the name.

We recommend users to use earphones/headphones when trying it out, since we implement 3D sound elements into the game. 

Explore **your** room and solve the puzzles so you can escape and go back into your own dimension!
